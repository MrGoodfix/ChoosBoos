# ChoosBoos

This is a project designed to create a choose your own adventure writing and browsing application. The intention is to use 
test driven development and setup the core of the application behind a web api with a single page application for the front
end. Each project will have its own test project and nunit is the current selection for a testing framework. If everything 
goes well I'll add other UI interfaces that tie into the web api as well.
